# Slot_Game_Js

This project is a simple slot machine game implemented in JavaScript using Node.js. It simulates a slot machine experience where the player deposits money, chooses how many lines to bet on, places a bet per line, and spins the reels to potentially win money based on matching symbols.

Key Features:
Deposit System: The player starts by depositing money into their account.
Line Betting: The player chooses to bet on 1 to 3 lines, influencing the outcome and risk.
Dynamic Betting: The bet amount per line is input by the player, and the total bet is deducted from the player's balance.
Reel Spinning: The game simulates slot machine reels using random selection from a pool of symbols ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D'), each with different counts and values.
Win Calculation: If a row contains identical symbols, the player wins an amount based on the symbol value and bet amount.
Replay Option: After each game, the player can choose to play again as long as they have balance left.
The project demonstrates the use of JavaScript functions, loops, arrays, object manipulation, and user input handling.
